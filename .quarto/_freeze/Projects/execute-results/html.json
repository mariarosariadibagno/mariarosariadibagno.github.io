This time frame provides a balance of historical perspective and recent data reliability. The research aims to link environmental politics and sustainable practices through the use of R Studio for **spatial analysis** and **Geographic Information Systems** (GIS).\n\n\n*Explore the findings from my extensive research on the relationship between climate change and drought intensity in New Zealand through my presentations:*\n\n- Delve into a *comprehensive analysis* that connects environmental politics, sustainable practices, and advanced computational methods: <br>\n[View My Final Presentation](docs/Final_Project.html) \n <br>\n- Discover a *brief overview* of the critical insights and conclusions of my study: <br>\n[Access My Memo Presentation](docs/memo_Project.html) \n\n",
