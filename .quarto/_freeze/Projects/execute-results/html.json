It is an extensive project that analyzes the relationship between *climate change* and *drought intensity* in **New Zealand**, a region known for its susceptibility to **droughts**.\nBeginning with a global context, the study traces developments from 1972—the year of the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment—to 2022. \n\n\nThis time frame provides a balance of historical perspective and recent data reliability. The research aims to link environmental politics and sustainable practices through the use of R Studio for **spatial analysis** and **Geographic Information Systems** (GIS).\n\n\n*Explore the findings from my extensive research on the relationship between climate change and drought intensity in New Zealand through my presentations:*\n\n- Delve into a *comprehensive analysis* that connects environmental politics, sustainable practices, and advanced computational methods: <br>\n[View My Final Presentation](docs/Final_Project.html) \n <br>\n- Discover a brief overview of the critical insights and conclusions of my study: <br>\n[Access My Memo Presentation](docs/memo_Project.html) \n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n<!-- empty column to create gap -->\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"20%\"}\n\n![](images/1606830999754.png){width=\"350\" height=\"auto\"}  \n\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n",
