Beginning with a global context, the study traces developments from 1972—the year of the first **United Nations Conference on the Human Environment**—to 2022. This time frame provides a balance of historical perspective and recent data reliability. The research aims to link environmental politics and sustainable practices through the use of R Studio for **spatial analysis** and **Geographic Information Systems** (GIS).
