Hi! My name is Mariarosaria Di Bagno, and I am proud to announce my graduation from John Cabot University where I have cultivated a robust academic foundation with a Bachelor's degree in International Affairs and minors in Economics and Legal Studies. These disciplines have afforded me a multidimensional understanding of the global landscape, which is instrumental in addressing the complex challenges of today's interconnected world.

My academic journey has been driven by an unwavering commitment to understanding the intricate tapestry of global economic and legal frameworks and their intersection with international relations. This has nurtured my analytical abilities and equipped me with the critical thinking skills necessary to navigate and influence the multifaceted realms of policy, economics, and law.

Beyond the classroom, I have actively sought opportunities to apply my knowledge in practical settings. My passion for sustainability and fashion is more than a personal interestâ€”it is a lens through which I view potential career paths. I am deeply invested in exploring how these industries can intersect to promote eco-friendly practices, ethical manufacturing, and consumer responsibility, striving to be at the forefront of advocating for sustainable development within the fashion sector.

As I step into the professional world, I am eager to bring my educational background, passion, and fresh perspectives to an organization that values innovation, social responsibility, and sustainability. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to meaningful projects that not only align with my career aspirations but also serve a greater purpose in driving positive change.
