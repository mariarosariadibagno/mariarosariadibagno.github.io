### GAMUN -Global Action Model United Nations 
**My Role at GAMUN 2024 (20-23 May)** <br>
In May 2024, I had the honor of contributing to the seventh edition of the Global Action Model United Nations (GAMUN), hosted at the [International Fund for Agricultural Development](https://www.ifad.org/en/) in Rome. This event is a flagship project of Global Action Italyâ€™s Diplomacy Education, dedicated to promoting **accessible, high-quality education on a global scale**.

My involvement began in the intricate planning and organizational phases, where I was part of the **managerial team** responsible for the logistical and strategic execution of the conference. This role required meticulous attention to detail and a deep understanding of how to cultivate an environment conducive to fruitful discussions and meaningful outcomes.

Following my responsibilities in management, I transitioned to a pivotal academic role, chairing the World Food Programme (WFP) commission. Here, I guided deliberations on "Building Resilience: Food Assistance for Disaster-Prone Communities" and "Urban Food Insecurity: Strategies for Ensuring Access in Cities." These discussions aimed to address some of the most pressing challenges in global food security, focusing on innovative and sustainable solutions.

My dual roles at GAMUN 2024 allowed me to leverage both organizational and academic skills. The experience not only reinforced my leadership capabilities but also deepened my commitment to fostering international cooperation and education to address global issues. It was a privilege to  learn alongside a team of passionate individuals, all working towards a common goal of making education accessible and effective.
